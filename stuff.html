						We live in Florida. Florida has hurricanes. Hurricanes cause power outages. I think you can connect the dots. The bonus on this being that it can run off either gas or propane, and can either run things off extension cords or go directly into the home electric via a transfer switch.

						I'm about halfway through removing about 40 old half-dead hedges from the yard. Which means about 40 stumps to dig out, along with a lot of invasive vines that created this problem to begin with. This has been a godsend for just destroying the underground roots we've dealt with. tl;dr it's not a catchy name, this thing slays roots.

						<a href="https://amzn.to/4aNe0Vk" target="_blank" class="text-emerald-500 text-larger-110 single-stuff-name-link">Breathable Rubber Coated Garden Gloves</a>
						I've got gloves for heavy duty work, but those aren't really meant for the Florida outdoors when I'm in the yard or garden doing something. These waterproof gloves provide great cover and make it so I my hands don't get caked in dirt and bugs. Which is better.

						This thing is simply awesome. Like, it shouldn't be as good for how cheap it is. I actually own two of them, so my wife and I could tag-team some large landscaping projects. This thing is light, the battery life is pretty good, and the replacement chains are dirt-cheap. You can cut trees down with this.

						After a trip to Tokyo, I don't think I could live without one of these. There is one on every terlet in the house, and I've even given one to a friend as a gift. He then got one for every terlet in HIS house. This just hooks right in to the existing water lines and connections, and will leave you feeling as though you've been missing out for a long time.

						<a href="https://amzn.to/3TIJhmF" target="_blank" class="text-emerald-500 text-larger-110 single-stuff-name-link">Navage Nasal Irrigation System</a>
						Do you have sinus or allergy issues? Of course you do, because everyone does. We wash the rest of our bodies, so why not the sinuses? This is like a neti pot on steroids, which means you're gonna pull things out of your face that you never thought could exist there. The first time I used it, I was able to breathe through my nose better than I had in over a decade. After 1 use.

						<a href="https://amzn.to/3x4HobX" target="_blank" class="text-emerald-500 text-larger-110 single-stuff-name-link">Low Profile Window Fan & Exhaust</a>
						We have two of these in the house. At times, the humidity inside gets above what either of us find comfortable, so keeping these on "exhaust" mode running low keeps that under control. And when the air outside is nice, switching it over takes a single button press.
					</p>

						<a href="https://amzn.to/4b29vWR" target="_blank" class="text-emerald-500 text-larger-110 single-stuff-name-link">Collapsible Folding Wagon</a>
						This gets used for everything around the house. Personally, it helps getting all the groceries out of the truck and into the house on one trip, as things melt quickly here. Also, it's great for hauling bags of water softener salt around the side to the garage without having to lug a bunch of 40lb bags by hand.

						<a href="https://amzn.to/4c59Mtk" target="_blank" class="text-emerald-500 text-larger-110 single-stuff-name-link">Technivorm Moccamaster</a>
						If you care about your coffee, it's worth the money. I got my first one in 2013, and I only "replaced" it when I got a larger capacity one when my wife moved in. And I absolutely saved the first one. It brews quickly, has no settings other than the on button, and it makes a perfect pot every time. I personally have one with the carafe, as the glass pot on a burn plate ruins the coffee.

						<a href="https://amzn.to/3KsdG3x" target="_blank" class="text-emerald-500 text-larger-110 single-stuff-name-link">Breville Smart Grinder Pro</a>
						Don't let the "smart" label interfere. This isn't connected to the internet or use an app. It's a legit professional grade grinder that I've had since 2017 and it's a champ. This was recommended to me by a friend in Australia who takes his coffee even more seriously than I do.
